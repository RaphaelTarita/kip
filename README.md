# kip

"kip" stands for Kotlin Image Processing. This is a personal toy project in which I played around with interacting and modifying images in Kotlin.

The main focus lies on programmatic definition of filters (like brighten, darken, saturate, color curve modifications etc.), which are composed in a
functional fashion, heavily utilizing lambdas and higher-order functions.
